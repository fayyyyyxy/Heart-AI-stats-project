## Project Description

This project contains work related to both machine learning modeling for predicting major cardiovascular outcomes and risk score development from the modelâ€™s prediction.  
The outcomes analyzed include Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE), Heart Failure (HF), and Death.  
The project involves data preprocessing, model training using XGBoost, performance evaluation, and risk stratification.

## Dataset Used

> **Note:** The actual datasets are not included in this repository due to privacy and confidentiality restrictions. The following describes the datasets used during the project:

#### ANON36_data
- Anonymized baseline datasets used for outcome prediction.
- Three separate datasets were used, each tailored for predicting MACE, HF, or Death, respectively.

#### ANON36_data_EKG
- Extended versions of ANON36_data incorporating EKG-derived features (e.g., VentricularRate, QTInterval).
- Three corresponding datasets were used, aligned with the baseline data for MACE, HF, and Death.

## Folder Descriptions

### Data Preprocessing
- Contains R scripts for selecting and preparing modeling variables, including demographic variables, risk factors, clinical variables, clinical risk scores, medication, and CT image analysis variables.
- Handles data cleaning, imputation, encoding, and feature transformation to generate consistent modeling inputs across all outcomes.

### XGBoost_Feature Importances and ROC
- Visualizes feature importance (gain, weight, cover) from trained XGBoost models.
- Includes ROC plots to connect feature contributions with outcome-specific model performance.

### XGBoost_ROC Comparison
- Compares against baseline models that each relied solely on a single clinical risk score for prediction, highlighting the added value of the full feature set and machine learning approach.

### XGBoost_ROC for each fold
- Contains ROC plots for each cross-validation fold, separately for MACE, HF, and Death models.
- Assesses the stability and generalizability of each model.

### XGBoost_Confusion Matrix
- Contains confusion matrices summarizing classification performance on testing data for all three outcomes.

### XGBoost_SHAP
- Includes SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) plots to explain model predictions globally and at the individual level.

### Develop Risk Score_MACE
- Focused on developing a clinically interpretable risk score framework specifically for MACE.
- Explored multiple strategies for defining risk group cutoffs, including slope detection on the predicted probability distribution curve to identify inflection points, percentile-based thresholds (e.g., 5th, 50th, 95th percentiles), and comparison against existing clinical risk score cutoffs.
- Evaluates and compares the resulting groupings using event rates, group-specific AUC, and weighted AUC.
